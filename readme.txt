The data files should be placed in the same folder as the compiled classes

UPDATE:

We should make the following package `edu.ccsf.proj.obit`  
I would also try to create this type of structure in github. 
`CCSFCodersClubObituaryProject/src/edu/ccsf/proj/obit`   <-- something like this (if possible)
