this insidious dis
ease and numerous treatments with an admirable grace that was true to his nature
David was born and raised near Boston After adventures in various rcgions of the country he stopped over one night in San Francisco in the early 19705  never to go roamin no more David was extremely intelligent articulate caring sensitive impeccably mannered and possessed of a wickedly sharp wit As those who loved him knew he took friendships seriously and those he made were true and enduring He loved fine literature great music the art of Faberge Bette Davis and giraffes He was an ardent Anglophile especially fond of the Tudors and Windsors and greatly enjoyed his visits to London Those of us left behind will miss him dearly and remember him fondly
