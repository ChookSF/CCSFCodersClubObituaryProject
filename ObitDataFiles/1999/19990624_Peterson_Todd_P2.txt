Todd Peterson
Todd Peterson cruelly ripped from our lives lune I2 His age was a riddle Wherever he may have started life he was the kind of person who had to live here The most
haughty of all pra
tcnseshatterers he did not suffer fools kindly His commitment was total indefatigable and expecting nothing in return His wit and enthusiasm could leave one breathless or begging for mercy He worked in some of the exotic corners of the city from Enricos and the Portman Hotel to the Nob Hill Adult Theatre always adding a bit of incendiary excitement He leaves behind a shattered tribal family of friends and coworkers because once connected Todd became a force in 0nes life Of N those with whom he started life he said it best at the passing of his lover He was fathered by truth and mothered by love
