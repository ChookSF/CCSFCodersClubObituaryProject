Franklin Hiles October 27 1961  March 8 1999
Franks life slipped away on Monday March 8 He was 37 At his 20th birthday party he was told he had AIDS and only six months to live Over the next l7 years AIDS both forged
and challenged his entire adult life Even so he had been around the world four times worked as a draftsman on the plans for NYCs twin towers survived being homeless one winter on the streets of NYC recovered from numerous bouts of pneumonia sowed more hemp than Iohnny Appleseed did trees and touched more lives than will ever be known
Music was his passion his savior and his addiction He had worked in NY as a D and even played at NYCs famed club the Saint By the time he reached SF neuropathy had robbed him of the free use of his legs Still music would lift him upand he would dance and spin his way to Nirvana where he was once again healthy and whole Franks passion for life was intense To those around him it was both inspiring and infectious He is dearly missed by all who knew him Good journey my friend until our paths cross again
