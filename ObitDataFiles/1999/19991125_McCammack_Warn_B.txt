Warn B Mcfiammack July 24 1940  September 10 1999
Always the character and fighting till the end Warn left us after a nearly threeyear battle with lung cancer and diabetes on 10 September 1999 Born in Louisville Kentucky Warn moved with his mother to Los Angeles where he spent 25 years in various fields including interior and lighting design banking and as a bartender After moving to San Francisco he held various positions until being disabled We met
shortly after his arrival Friday 13 lune 1981 and were together from that date As he always said everyone can have a lover we are companions Till the end the sense of humor was there Of course so was the temper that many times got him into trouble He always said what he thought and held nothing back You either liked him or not no in between I did for over 19 years Special thanks to Gary and Tom whose help made it all go a little easier True friends good people To John you should be proud of all your efforts when he really needed you
At Warns request his body was donated to research and the ashes scattered His wish to all who knew him was Hey this isnt a down time Ive had a good one Have a party
Safe passage my friend Love Stan
