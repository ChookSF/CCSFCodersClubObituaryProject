We sit in awe and disbelief finding ways to deal with grief One of the few who really did care you would ask for help and he was there He fought for me and you and him think of goodness you think of Jim A boss a leader a faithful friend our love for Jim will never end His life was full he lived for today he made me proud to say Im Gay Hel left this life by angels hands to take his place in Gods master plans So grieve not long be strong and grow the way Jim wants it as you all know Carry on the things he stood for so open your heart dont close loves door Try to smile be glad and cheer Cause look around and Jim is near Keep love in your heart and understand Hes taken his place at gods right hand paid for by friends of Jim McGowan
