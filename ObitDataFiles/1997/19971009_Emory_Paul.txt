Paul lived his time with us in a unique and spontaneous wayWhen he first arrived in the Bay Area from Louisiana in the early 19805 he had n hard time getting used to the City His goal was 0 find 1 quiet W in the country to call home and eventually he moved to the Russian River living mostly in Guerncville
Paul worked for some of the resorts at the River and was 1 loyal and responsible employee For a short time he was the manager of The Woods Resort He was well known to River residents and was a contact for visitors who wanted to make their stay in the Guerneville area more enjoyable Living with HIV during the last few years was difficult but his constant and strong spirituality saw him through nuiny painful episodes of ill health He always seemed to bounce back Paul was a kind and trustworthy fricnd to many of us  sharing his unique perspective on life joking with us offering us his homespun Southern wisdon1Thnsc and
