Tom was born on July 4 1950 in Michigan where he grew up He received a BA from Oakland University and an MS from Michigan State University Like so many other men from around the country Tom moved to San Francisco in the late 19705 searching not so much for Oz but simply for a place in which he could live freely That place was and still is San Francisco Tom worked first for the Public Health Hospital and then made his career at Syntax Corporation in Palo Alto starting as a lab assistant and working his way up to supervisor of the Quality Control Laboratory He retired on disability in May 1990
Tom and l met on March 6 I981 While I doubt either one of us was looking for a partner in those naive days at least for me love was immediate We had an instant joy in each 0thers company and except for those rare occasions involving long distance trips for business or family require ments we talked to each other every single day for the next 16 years
Tom is survived by his mother Eleanor Holcomb of Zephyr Hills Fla his father Nelson Gamble of Addison Mich and me his partner David King Tom died of AIDS on March 20 with me beside him For now our journcy is interrupted our love continues
