like enthusiasm and trust could get him into trouble for two years he was cmbroiled in a legal struggle which was chronicled by the BAR Unsubstantiated charges caused the title of San Francisco Leather Daddys Boy which he won in 1993 to be taken away from him By the time his good name was legally cleared his title year had long passed and a shadow had dimmed the honor of our community An amazingly upbeat soul David did not let this dominate his life Even after having to go on disability frnm his job at Levi Strauss he continued to work on renovating the home and garden that he shared with his partner of nine years Steven Miller
David was known for his freckled face red hair and natural perkiness Always eager to Help others he was often seen at the SF Eagle and involved in many community organizations He will be missed for his sunshine and delicate goodness A celebration of his life is planned for Saturday April 5
