Dennis Wayne Kennedy Aug 31 1944  Jan 22 1997
A native Orcgonian Dennis passed away at Ralph K Davies He came to San Francisco in the 60s and called it home thereafter Dennis lived his last years in seclusion to concentrate on his 11year struggle with AIDS and other medical problems too many to mention Personal growth selfeducation and esoteric interests were the foundations of his mind and knowledge His legacy will live on through his artwork and the tarot cards he designed with his 13year companion and soulmate Tom Dennis is survived by his grandmother Marie Knapp his mother Gladys Kennedy two brothers Mike and Terry and his friend Tom His gentle ways optimism warmth and sensibility serve as an example to all who cared about him
Dennis you were the best thing that ever happened to me Thank you  Tom
