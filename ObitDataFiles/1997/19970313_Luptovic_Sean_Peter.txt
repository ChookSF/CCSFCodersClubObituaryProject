To all of you who knew Sean and especially those who provided moral and other support during the last eight months we can only say thank you When he am became in Sean was surprised at the support that to him seemed to come out of nowhere He did not until his last months realize how much he was liked and the number of people who liked him
We will miss Sean for his companionship his wit his insights and his commentaries on people and life in general We will miss him for his sometimes ornery attitude But most of all we will miss him for the spice he brought to this existence we call life Our love is with you Sean always
