Hard to believe you would have been 4 years old this week Even harder to believe youve been gone from us for 3l/2 years But you live in my heart daily  that beautiful face
your sweet soul and the way you could always make me laugh All of these and more bring a wistful smile to my face every time I think of you
Love forever Eric
