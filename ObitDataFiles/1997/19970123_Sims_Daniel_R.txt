Surrounded by his family and friends Dan de parted on his last earthly journey at 135 pm It was a rainy and dreary day completely ting the mood of
those of us who re
mained Were certain that his lover of more than 10 years was awaiting him and that they soared
vemures V Dan will be missed by those he loved Those who didnt meet his criteria of humanity no longer need be apprehensive There are fewer accomplishments greater than knowing who one is and Dan had become comfortable with his own selfknowledge
Dan was a skilled artist had a tremendous knowledge of music was witty and clever and was a fiercely loyal friend May his journey bring him joy
