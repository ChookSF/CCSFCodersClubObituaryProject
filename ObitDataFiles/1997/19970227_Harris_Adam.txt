Adam Harris
We will remember our friend Adam Harris as he was in life generous charming and vibrant A transplanted New Yorker he graced the Bay Area for 20 years until at age 48 he lost his hardfought battle with cancer Of his many beautiful qualitieshis ability to turn mundane or unpleasant circumstances into an adventure will be missed the most
i thought id have a lifetime/whaats left of one at least i forgot about the darkened wood/the nature of the beast
we walked along in sunlight no special place to be/then he took a side trail/turned and said goodbye to me that trail remains a mystery no beginning and no end/no single sign to help me find/what happened to my friend
i walk along in shadow now/deeper into the wood/i know he knew id miss him/that much was understood
Love  Rose Carlos Pamand Craig
