In Memoriam
Richard Craig Corville Nov 14 1949  April 2 1996 O Richard grower of sweet smelling roses tender of wild herbs and rare flowers 0 Richard always the impetuous one
You before we ever imagined youd be gone
Lover of Kitty lover of birds of your fiiends  family you walk now among the brave new worlds of the bright shining stars you watched Yet you are not gone you come in dreams to say hello and visit for awhile One can not turn round most days without some sweet memory 
A sunny hilltop a fragrant garden your quixotic sense of humor
We love you still We miss you still and remember you now and always
 with love from your sister Carol on behalf of your Mom  Dad your partner Tom other family  fiiends all whom your smiling joy touched
