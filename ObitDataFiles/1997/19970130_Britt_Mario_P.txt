No words could ever describe you  your smile the way it lit up your face Nothing could describe the absence of that smile the way you could shut down and tune us all out Like an island in the sea with many waves at your edges you stood alone and watched them roll Few visitors were allowed and then not for long Like an antenna to heaven you transferred to us all a babes innocent love of life  in every spin or pirouette on the dance floor or the kitchen floor  it didnt matter God bless the child you had your own
