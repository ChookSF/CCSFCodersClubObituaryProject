Words cannot express the gratitude that I feel for knowing you almost 20 years I felt like Cinderella at the ball
When the clock struck almost half past nine am on that dark Saturday December 7 last year a date FDR said would livc in infamy my clock struck midnight and my fairy talc ball was over My
world ended life had lost its sparkle Kingdoms come and go but they don last Before you know it the future is the past The sun comes up and seasons change but hope lives on and love
Until we meet again baby brother
