Louis lived in Polk Gulch/Lower Nob Hill almost his entire life but decided to cool his little heels in Concord l the past five years He worked at Pac Bell here umil one year ago his last position was as a service rep
Louis had many friends lle liked getting gussied up and going out to wild bars He was adventurous and generous He was also very concerned about his chosen family and how his illness and eventual death would affect us
Louis loved his lifestyle and lived well When things finally got really bad for him he tried to make the best of it We talked about Venice his favorite city a lot when his KS and AIDS got him down He ordered jewelry and face creams from to cheer himself up Louis was fun and a perfect friend and I know that someday we can talk and be together again A private service was held at the Queen of Saints Church in Concord on September 21
