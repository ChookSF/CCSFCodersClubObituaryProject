Forest Baker 1943  1997 L
Forest died last month from AIDS Following his wishes there was a private cremation 
without ceremony Forests real
life began with a decision to leave
the apparently
heartless Napa Calif family of his growingup time He arrives here with the hippie era Much chaos A plunge into antiwarwork the political streak resurfaces later  ACT UP DNCB in the 80s And having a butterfly nature hes soon making beautiful collages too plus stunning bead work and fab art quilts The many faces of Forest And developing a rich social life at the hippie gay bar The Capri Here he meets his best friend Michael Ford Will the party go on forever
ln New York problems Shooting up with neargreat slcazs and glam queens Ondine and Holly As this gradually appears to take its toll he thinks Why not leave this and go back
He does Once back here in the 80s theres a settling down The speeds stopped being a problem Hes older and quieter isnt he So he meets loverfor life Sam Oops its the 90s Where did the time go What to do now
For my last act Forest does the Capri oral history interviews Taping survivors of back then Theyre great But its time to go So he does Au revoir honey and goddess bless if there is one to bless Much love  B
