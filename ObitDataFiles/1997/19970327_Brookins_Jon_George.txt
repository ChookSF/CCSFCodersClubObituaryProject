Jon George Brookins Dec 4 1957  March 22 1997
Ion spent his final days in the comfort of the  Waller Street home he shared with lohn Carr his life partner As his family and many friends gathered to
be with him fond
memories were shared and new bonds were made The alltoobrief time we had been allowed to know Jon in our lives was suddenly larger for which we are grateful
When spirit was freed fromthe vessel that could no longer contain it in this world it passed through family and friends as they touched and soothed him through the end of his painful journey As he had cheered and charmed our lives he began healing our deep loss through his metamorphosis
One of Jons greatest joys was creating unforgettable dinner parties It is his wish that donations to Project Open Hand be made in lieu of flowers
