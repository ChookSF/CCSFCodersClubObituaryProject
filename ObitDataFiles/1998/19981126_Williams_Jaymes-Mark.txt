As a bigvoiced and exuberant bassbaritorm he also appeared in trousers often with the Lamplightcrs and at the Bracebridge Christmas dinncrs in Yosemite
There are no appropriate words no poetry to describe the loopy silly benign glow that IaymcsMark always seemed to emit and his deep tender soul that was almost palpable beneath his skin
He was one of lifes gentle creatures and his friends and many significant others feel a great sadness that we will no longer enjoy the simple pleasure of his presence
A memorial concert to celebrate jaymesMark is planned for the Spring
