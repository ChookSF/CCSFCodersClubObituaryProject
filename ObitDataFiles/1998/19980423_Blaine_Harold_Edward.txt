An astounding talent for written cacpression a genuine bibliuphilc an insaliable passion for football especially his bcluvcd 49ers a zeal for exploring provocative social issues and a fervent love of animals and rock music these formed just a small part of the lllV0lLllC mosaic that defined Harolds intense intellectual curiosity wisdom and unsuilicd sophistication
