Margaret Ann Manning December 7 1997
My mother liberated years before it was fashionable was also one hell ofa great lady
A devout Roman Catholic she still had 1 great love in her heart for her youngest son me who came out to her many years ago Her liberal attitude was evident in her strong support of 1 w0mans right to choose gay rights and a host of other causes
Shc was always there for me someone I could always call or write to for advice for understanding She always said how proud she was of her gay son How fortunate I was having such great parents whose unconditional love I could always depend on My dad who passed away in I995 was a great guy He and my mom were a great team for many years
l miss you both very much Your son Richard
