OUR ROMANCE FOLDED ON A SORROWFUL NOTE GONE BY TOMORROW
THE SONG IS ENDED BUT AS THE SONGWTIITER WROTE
THE MELODY LINGERS ON
THE WAY YOU WORE YOUR HAT

THE WAY YOUR SMILE JUST BEAMED
THE WAY YOU SANG OFF KEY

BUT ILL ALWAYS AL/AYS KEEP THE MEMORY OF
THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR KNIFE Tm my we DANCED nu 5
Tm WAY YOU CHANGED MY uni
N0 um mm my 11mr AWAY FROM ME NO THEY CANT TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME
