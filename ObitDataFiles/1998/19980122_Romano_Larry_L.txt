ncss and exuber
ancc for life He lived life to the fullest and during his 39 years he accomplished more than most people do in a full 70year lifetime
Larrys most unique gift was making each one of us feel as if we were the most important person on earth His love of life included his love for the music and life of the 19205 and 1930s An Art Deco Society Ball he truly enjoyed This interest carried over to his work and hobby off restoring and collecting old phonographs radios clocks and antiques
Up to the last few days and hours Larry was still enjoying life with a smile still making friends determined to hold on to life as long as he could Donations in his name will be gladly accepted for the Circle of Friends/National AIDS  Memorial Grove SF AIDS Foundatinn Ellipse San Mateo County or the American Cancer Society
