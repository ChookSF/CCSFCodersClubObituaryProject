Douglas C Gilchrist March 10 1998
Douglas C Gilchrist was taken away from us during the early morning hours of March 10 A native of Chico Calif he was only 38 Knowing the pain of loneliness the Master saw fit
to loan me Douglas in Iune I981 That same month we left San Francisco looking for a better life in Southern California After a disastrous experience there we came back to San Francisco the city we never should have left three years later
This time around it seemed like San Francisco and its people not only welcomed us back but also gave us the opportunity to get on our feet However wc had to do the foot work but we madc it work for us Doug was happy I could sec it in his cycs
On the morning of March 10 I was very angry for God had decided to rcncgc on the loan and pick the most beautiful flower I have ever known He knew it was time and he wanted to save Douglas the suffering that was yet to come A special thanks to Ward 86s Dr lill Legg for all her help Conrad also wants to thank Douglas many friends for being so generous and kind while he was with us
