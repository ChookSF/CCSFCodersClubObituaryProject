Daryl P Kirk 1950  1998
With peace honor and dignity you departed on a cloud of pure love the night of April 7 after a long heroic battle with AIDS
Your physician Dr Shelley Gordon
was your guide and
your support from the beginning Smiling and radiant as always you shared the last goodbyc with your bubba Mark unsinkable family Kirk care giving angel Stuart loyal buddy Egabert soul brothers Mark George and Iohn and constant friend and nurse Denise The grief is unbearable but such a small price for the infinite unconditional love energy and strength you gave Daryl you showed us a way to live with courage in times of fear hope in times of despair laughter in times of grief forgiveness in times of anger  and our humanity is enlarged furit The candle that burns twice as bright burns only half as long but your flame will continue to burn within us for as long as we have memories
Festive spirits will gather at your home on Sunday April I9 at 2 pm to rejoice and remember N0 flowers please Send donations in Daryls memory to Project Open Hand so they can keep helping those who are not as blessed with such an abundance of devoted fans
