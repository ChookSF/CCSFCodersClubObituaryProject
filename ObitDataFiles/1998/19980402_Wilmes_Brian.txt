To a man of passion and graciousness
Thank you and bless you for all you brought to our community and the individuals who comprise it From the moment we met you carefully described your role in this universe as potential developer defined as one who could see the larger potential in the people you met and had the second gift of being able to help them see it as well
This true commitment to growth in others was both noble and rare and could never have been done without your passion and graciousness Many a time I witnessed your magic slowly entering into the eyes of someone  and your
listening ears and catching arms there in case the individual needed support
Your home was always open for a chat for a nag or for more
