Gary Manger Dec 16 1938  April 11 1998
Unique in life Gary Monger chose 1 rare form of brain cancer to be the cause of death He left peacefully and with his usual smile on his face That smile was famous 
it lit up all our lives
 but it was also enigmatic never letting on about Garys personal pain or problems He was our ruck and our glue Everyone else was prioritized over himself Practically every cabaret performer in town owes him their continued success is his legacy His personal satisfaction always came from planning and promoting others careers  or events that somehow benefited our community
It is difficult to imagine anyone whose life has not been touched by AIDS but Gary made it a cause for living None of us will ever forget the hundreds of thousands of dollars that he raised with the assistance of those he regularly coerced with events such as In Memory of Friends Gary transformed all he touched even garage sale clothes looked spiffy on him  he would not waste money better spent on emertaining friends Donations in his may be made to the AIDS Emergency Fund or the American Cancer Society Those wishing to participatci11 hisfinalcocktail party can calI 4157030614
