Antonio Garcia Ochoa
Antonio Garcia Ochoa Went forth from this earth after struggling more than 15 years with AIDS on Wednesday June 12 about 20 minutes past midnight He navigated the unruly terrain of the debilitating illness with a remarkably consistent good humor
Tony cared passionately His home was more often than not a secure place to find lodging for a few days for many a homeless person He seemed to possess a genius for friendship He told folks he was lending them money or Whatever as it turns out chiefly to make not entirely on the receiving end and to assure that they retain their dignity but he never accepted anything back Mostly he very simply and nonchalantly shared himself  all that he had all that he was And is
Tony is survived by his three sisters Lydia Connie and Carmen and his younger brother Lupe and his mother Senora Hildelisa Ochoa His tender and indefatigable spirit remains a source of strength sustenance to them and to us He is also survived by his beloved foster father Dr Cameron Thompson who cared for him over a span of 27 years Tonys spirit helped those of us who were graced to accompany him at various times throughout his 43 years on earth and that will never cease
