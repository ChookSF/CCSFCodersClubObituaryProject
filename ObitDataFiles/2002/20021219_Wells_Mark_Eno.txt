Mark Wells Eno
The Mission District lost one of its brightest lights when En0s long struggle with AIDS ended on Sunday December 8 2002 We ask that he be remembered with love and joy Former rock and roll musician Eno was born in Auburn California on March 15 1961 He is survived by his longtime domestic partner Jose Ramirez his mother Jeanette Jamison of Nebraska three siblings Kirk Dianna and Roxanna and by his extended family at The Phone Booth and the Mission Bar A memorial celebration of his life was held at the latter establishment on Wednesday December 11
Eno was a gentle soul who never had an unkind word to say about anyone Like this writer he loved to drink and eat probably in that order 
Eno at some point well all reconvene at that big cocktail lounge in the sky Sleep with angels little brother
