Mike Everett passed in his sleep on May 1 2001 the day before he would have turned S4 with his partner of 27
years by his side Mike had suffered from various ill
nesses and was in and out of the hospital for two and a half years Mike met his lifetime partner Ken in 1975 and both lost their hearts to each other Mike was a volunteer with Visiting Nurses and Hospice for over 10 years and helped raise money for the AIDS Emergency Fund for several years Over the years Mike touched so many hearts with his humor and wit He will be missed by family friends and especially his partner
Michael we miss your gentle kindness and caring We revere your dignified and principled stands A star has gone from our heaven One we will never forget yet always treasure Such an honor to have known you The rainbows we experienced with you will be forever Bless your good sweetheart
