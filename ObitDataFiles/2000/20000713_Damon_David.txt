David Damon July 24 1949  May 9 2000
Its hard to believe that you have already been gone two months David and yet here I am still acknowledging the event Almost half my life was spent with you and your 18 years of HIV and AIDS and still I wasnt ready Every cookbook every piece of crystal and every photograph was boobytrapped with memories exploding all around
me
Well I think Im getting a grip on this David but I never knew how hard it was to say goodbye Still there is much of you aroundyour voice
I hear it still your
way of being the part of me that is you S0 OK David  I can accept that youre gone now but  how else to say it  never ever to be forgotten Goodbye dear friend  see you at the AIDS Memorial Grove
