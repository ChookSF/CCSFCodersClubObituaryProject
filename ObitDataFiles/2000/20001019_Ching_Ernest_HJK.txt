Ernest HJK Ching
He was a popular entertainment director in the 1970s disco era the founder and leader
of a Hawaiian gay group called the Polynesian Royal Court and he was  high priest of the
Sandwich Islands Thousands of gay and lesbian people enjoyed the performances There was impeccable Tahitian and Hawaiian dancing and several exciting moments for the group which was composed of about 25 men and women This court was a crowd pleaser wherever it went
I remember Ernest getting several offers from different bars to entertain for them The group was a costumed spectacle of Hawaiian beauty I remember a time when our entourage dropped 200 cymbidium orchids at the feet of an
Empress who was shocked by the grandeur of this Hawaiian gggup
Unfortunately pictures of that
era are no longer available but I would bet there are a lot of former empress
types that would remember the shows I
was the manager of the group for four years
Ernest died peacefully in his sleep in
September of this year His memorial Website is at http//wwwgeocitiescom/hislife222
