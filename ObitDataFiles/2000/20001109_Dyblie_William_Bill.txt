William Bill Dyblie May 19 1947  October 18 2000
If you had any question about food Bill would know the answer lust weeks before his death one of his main concerns was locating a specific Martha Stewart recipe
Bill was a veteran and a longtime administrative assistant at UC Medical Center During the five years that he was homebound numerous wonderful health care workers took care of him Bill was grateful to all of them for both their care and their concern
He is survived by his mother and father Beth and Iohn of Falls City Nebraska and his brother Iay of Yakima Washington Bills ashes will be shipped to his hometown of Falls City for a memorial service Those wishing to make a donation in his honor should do so to either Maitri Hospice or their favorite AIDS organization
