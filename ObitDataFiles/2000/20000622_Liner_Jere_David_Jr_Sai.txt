Jere David Liner Jr January 26 1949  June 5 2000
It rained the night David Sai was in transition Unusual for this time I believe the city was weeping for a son it was losing David loved this city He was an
intellectual with a
high IQ an excellent cook and had a gift for gardening IIe could grow flowers anywhere when given a chance There was a magical charm and aura about this little guy But first and foremost one sees his courage It brings to mind David and Goliath This little David faced and fought this deadly disease Goliath head on for 18 years He may have lost in the end but he fought a mighty battle
My little friend my mighty warrior goodnight you little Prince of San F Francisco Till we meet idmiration to Davids mother Dorothy and brother Michael for seeing through the inevitable Its easy to see where David got his courage from Many thanks to Dr Lisa C and all the doctors and nurses at Davies Medical Center Thanks to all the people at Leyland House and to everyone who did what they could and then some
There will be a festive celebration of Davids life at Mount Tam on Sunday Iuly 9 from I4 pm For further information call Nick at 415 4311341
