Deb McCall
Deb died at home of heart failure on Iuly 23 to the great sorrow of friends family coworkers and just about everyone who was lucky enough to meet her
Born in Ohio Deb moved to the Bay Area 20 years ago and worked as the bookkeeper and Financial Manager for Good Vibrations since 1994 Nicknamed honest Deb as a
teenager her direct straightforward
style and wicked sense of humor were a joy to experience  and a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stifling environment of a feminist cooperative workplace She especially loved her mother the 49ers Hawaii and the theatre
Her pals at Good Vibrations the Lexington the MM  and most of all the Harrises gang  miss her huge heart her kindness and the sound of her laughter more than we can say
A memorial service will be held Wednesday August 9 at 9 am at the Unitarian Church 1187 Franklin St
