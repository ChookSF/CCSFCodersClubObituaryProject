Christof Banasiewicz February 4 1964 July 16 2000
Christofs life was taken suddenly from us in the middle of the night while he slept His stay among us was unexpectedly brief yet full of the joy of life shared generously with many
lucky friends Energetic and creative he was gifted with talents for all things artistic and radiated a unique sense of style This put his beautiful head high above the crowd his frequent laughter driven by his special dry wit His intelligence and sensitivity charmed all he knew all periods and styles and would amaze with his knowledge of all song lyrics whether 1940s or today
He is survived by his soulmate Alexis who will always have him in his heart as will Christofs wide family of friends Christof will beloved and remembered always A memorial gathering will take place at l pm on sunday July 24 at the National AIDS Memorial Grove in Golden Gate Park
