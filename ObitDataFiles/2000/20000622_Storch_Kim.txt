Kim Storch July 18 1949  May 28 2000
Kim our beloved Ravin died unexpectedly of a heart attack on May 28 His friends will miss him dearly To have made it through the years of the plague and then die so suddenly seems unfair We didnt get a warning
Kim cofounded Community Life Projects a nonprofit offering support for the gay community and others IIe was a respected Iungian analyst in San Francisco over the past 25 years He was a magic drummer who set up full moon drumming circles at Grace Cathedral and used music as therapy in public and private life He was at fashion diva collecting hundreds of furs from thrift shops everywhere He lived among his mountains of treasures and gave them away to anyone in need He gave gifts
constantly and always had the perfect 
accessory for any outfit you could come up with A white fox jacket Short or long A peridot ring Sure A spare dining room table There is one somewhere in his front hall His chosen family was Black Leather Wings and he blessed us with his fashion acumen outfits for all drumming drumming drumming and
support of the tribe in any way he could
He died just before our gathering this year and we missed him greatly
Peace Kim and I hope you are finally released from your pain
