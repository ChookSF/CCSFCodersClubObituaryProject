A member of our League for over twenty years Bob was a high per

competitor For many years he held the rtrcord for Championship Team titles at a seemingly insurmountable total of fifteen His ability to digest analyze and retain statistical information was remarkable As a former League Historian and member of the Board of Governors his guidance and sense of continuity provided stability and order in an everchanging League landscape His mind was always intellectually active His knowledge of the motion picture entertainment and sports world was exceptional and he was a rare combination of book and street smart
He is survived by Steve Montgomery his partner of 24 years and a host of friends His spirit sense of humor and positive outlook will be sorely missed He becomes a part of our fondest memories
