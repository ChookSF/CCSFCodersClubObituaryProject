Richard E Deres 7 January 15 1937 April 2 2001
Richard quietly left us on the evening of April 2  his life partner of 13 years Dr Gregg Higuchi at his side and his favorite opera lifting his soul to his personal Valhalla His tenacity grit humor and grace during his illness inspired those around him Richard is survived by his brother Paul and his wife Debra and his sister Barbara Baldelli and her husband Reno He leaves behind friends and loved ones too numerous to count
There are so many things were going to miss about him His bearish growly exterior which was only a faeade
that melted away once he smiled and laughed his rumbling laugh His compassion and sense of what was right and fair His passion for good business opera and world travel His desire to always move forward because to stand still meant your were growing old  The streak of youth that gave him a personal fascination with innovative ideas and changes in culture His lack of natural athletic talent but his willingness to attempt sports even though he was an athlete currently trapped in an opera singers body He was one of a kind and a special friend
A memorial is planned for Friday April 27 at 1 pm at the Columbium In lue  of flowers a donation in Richards name to either the coming Home Hospice or the SF Opera would be appreciated
