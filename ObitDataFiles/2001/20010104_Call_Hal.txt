Rest in peace Hal
I was saddened to learn of the passing of Hal Call Bay Area Reporter December 21 issue I met him in the mid19605 after I had left the Army and was trying to find a community in San Francisco
We were close for a time but I got into the hippie and radical political movement and Hal was too conservative for that Still I value the time we knew one another and miss him now I went on to become the Acme Beer Man the model for the first attempt by a normal company to court the gay/bi community in 1975 By that time I hadnt seen Hal in several years I wrote a column for BAR in the late 1970s called Body Talk 
Hal was a courageous man He was open about his sexuality and philosophy at a time when that was rare He was a pioneer
People such as he are not remembered by those who think gay liberation started with Christopher Street but his value to the opening of minds and hearts was immense Let me add my voice to those of Bob Damron and Jose Sarria and the others who knew him and remember the Mattachine Society in giving a salutation to a life well lived
Seasons greetings Hal wherever your spirit is
