Charles passed away at the Coming Home Hospice Charles was a founder of the Gay Mens Spiritual Retreat where he wrote the following obituary
Charles died today I knew him well and loved him He was a good man for the most part kind considerate and sensitive to the needs of others His accomplishments in the general scheme ofthings would not be considered major he started no movements headed no corporations wrote no great literature
What excited him most was self knowledge In that he saw the path to loving and loving gave him his greatest joy IIe knew the cruelty of human existence but did not despair He was an optimist at heart who believed in human goodness
At an early age he knew he was gay and that his nature was abhorrent to many This knowledge gave him pain and was not reconciled during his lifetime
Charles was loved by many for his wit and compassion his willingness to listen and his depth of understanding In his later life he cared for the dying promoted gay rights and contributed his wisdom to the gay spiritual community
He was a feeling man loving and wise a beautiful man
