Todd James Shield
The Voices 11 nd antics of a great friend were silenced suddenly on November 3 2001 three days shy of 50 and two weeks shy of Harry Potter the motion picture Those who knew him will miss the many characters ready to burst forth at a moments notice from Katherine A Hepburn to Yoda and a with Sharper  k than his design knife Todd was born in Linwood Pennsylvania He began his foray into the world of floral design at the age of 17 a career that took him across the country and across the Pacific where he taught Westem design in Iapan and Taiwan Most recently he worked at Rosebowl Florist and Wine Shop in San Francisco
To all the lives he touched Todd will be greatly missed He was truly one of a kind Our loss is now the gain of the people who have already left us including his father his brother Tim and many many friends Somewhere now he is laughing with the angels
