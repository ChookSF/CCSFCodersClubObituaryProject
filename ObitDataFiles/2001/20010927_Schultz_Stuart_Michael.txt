On September l5th Stuart Peacefully died after a heroic battle with Cancer and a 15
Year battle with  HIV  and AIDS 
Stuart was a fighter until the very end and his illness would not slow him down He
loved our adorned city of San Francisco
He dedicated his time at Project Open Hand to help people in need He cherished his trips to the Farmers Market the Flower Mart and the many neighborhood street fairs always bringing home a small bit of our great city He loved being at his home in the Castro and working in the yard creating gardens
awash with bright beautiful flowers
And you would see Stuart on his walks to the park with his beloved fourlegged friends Egbert and Butch His wondrous and outspoken presence in the neighborhood will be sadly missed
The memory of Stuart will forever be bestowed in the hearts of his friends
and family in San Francisco Chicago and across the country His shared wisdom and love will be a part of us forever  In May we traveled to Disneyland and came together in celebration of his 60th birthday and during the time period of his passing we all came together and shared our love for Stuart On Sunday September 30th at 1 pm we will gather at his home to remember and celebrate the wonderful memories cherished by all
