Dennis Michael Ratz May 22 1940  January 15 2001
The world lost a sweet gentle but troubled soul when Dennis ended his life in January Years of depression and
recent medical problems proved too much for him to handle 
Dennis was born in Aurora Illinois and escaped to San Francisco in 1962 He had a sweet and gentle spirit and was a
loyal delightful friend to those lucky enough to cross his path He caught the end of the beatnik era welcomed the hippie generation and celebrated during the sexual revolution He also watched in horror as AIDS swept through San Francisco killing most of his male friends Dennis was a gardener for the City of San Francisco until his retirement in 1998 His garden spaces included Union Square the Conservatory of Flowers and Alamo Square where he cultivated his passion for working the earth Prior to his gardening career Dennis was an ER nurse and met many wonderful people many of whom remained close friends until the end Dennis is preceded in death by his parents Tina and Louis Ratz and his life partner Glen Dennis was an only child but he left behind a very close cousin Tom and many dear friends We all miss him terribly
