Dorrwin Jones will be missed
I read with great personal sadness the passing of one of our giants in the community Dorrwin Jones was not only a personal longtime friend and neighbor for many years but a mentor in our unique community and nation 
Yes he will be missed but that fabulous warm smile will forever be with us all that is for sure
