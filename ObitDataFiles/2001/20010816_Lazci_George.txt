George Lazci December 25 1942  July 6 2001
Dear Friend you left this world with many unanswered questions and many hearts aching Your escape from this life is hardly justifiable but somehow understandable You will still be with us at antique shows and film festivals at the Ballet the River and Palm Springs but mostly in our hearts and our treasure chest of memories Well never forget you and look forward to seeing you again
