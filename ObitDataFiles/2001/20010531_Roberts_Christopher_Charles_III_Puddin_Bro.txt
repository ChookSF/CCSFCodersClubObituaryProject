Christopher Charles Roberts Ill
Christopher Charles Roberts III was born on Iuly 30 1958 and gave up his ghost on May 20 2001 Otherwise known as Puddin and Bro Chris was always at heart a gentle spirit and loyal friend
He battled AIDS for over ten years and lived independently for most of those years
Chris managed to stretch a whole lifetime into those ten years since retiring from UC Berkeley in the early 90s Chris survived partners friends drinking buddies from the White Horse and other coworkers and still managed to always bring freshness to all his encounters
He managed in all that time to travel to Australia Europe and the Caribbean and when home would always be seen driving his precious Cadillac with his dog Hank as his copilot 
In his last few days Chris close friend Dorianne from UC Berkeley days stayed with him to the end We are going to miss our little buddy who was so full of life and zeal
Peace go with you Bro and know that you are being terribly missed
Adiue until we all meet again
