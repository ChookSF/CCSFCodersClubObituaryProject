Peter Dominick Koch April 25 1958  July 1 2001
Peter lived in San Francisco for the past 10 years From Midland Texas he kept his admirable Texas attitude slight accent and kickin sense of humor He
was bright and visionary and held great dreams  While striving to improve his life he shared his ideas and inspirations with others and continually surprised and amused many with his clever talents His generosity and humor reflected his loving and kind nature He loved his two cats and his green thumb was boldly prevalent in his home
Peter expressed his emotions with sincerity and affection and although his time here was not nearly long enough he made a strong impact on those he met and were fortunate enough to really get to know him I pray he has found the peace he has earned and truly deserves He will be forever remembered in my heart and in the hearts of those who knew and loved him I did We miss you dearly Peter
