David Barney McCormick June 27 1952  June 27 2001
On June 27 2001 Davids soul left his body and was carried by angels to his final resting place in heaven David was a kind and giving person who gave so much and asked for so little in return He lives on in the hearts and minds of those who knew and loved him Until we meet again
