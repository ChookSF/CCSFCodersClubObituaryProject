Michael James Collins died on January 102001 at 530 am at Davies Medical Center
He was born in Indiana on August 20 1957 to Sharon Collins and Donald Collins later adopted him
He was a tireless contributor to the community not in the common way like giving money to a group or sitting on a committee He would give money to the homeless he would give them some kind of a job to do so they would not feel it was a handout they had earned it He would take in runaways and let them stay until he could get them to call home and talk to their families It is his giftgiving spirit that we will remember the most and this world will miss the most 
So many friends will miss Michael He had a way of making friends no matter where he went and no person was too rich or too poor to be his friend Michael had a way of knowing when his friends were in need sometimes even before they knew they needed help You never had to ask him for anything he would already know just from listening to your words He helped so many and was loved by them all
His two sisters two brothers parents and many other family members survive him To Michael family was not just the blood that ran through his veins His family always included people that were there for him in his time of need when he needed a shoulder to cry on or a pat on the back Michael being the person that he was would not want us to mourn his death but rather celebrate his life that brought us all together to share in the laughter and the joy
