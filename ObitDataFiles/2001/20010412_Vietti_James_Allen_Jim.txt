James Allen Vietti November 17 1946  March 22 2001
Friend Brother Soulmate More words cannot describe the feelings that come to our hearts whenever we think of you Jim You were so many things to the so
many people that you touched in your brief stay here on earth it would take a book to get them all down  or a really good movie
The qualities that were unique to your personality are things that we all lack in ourselves While most can tell a story you listened Whereas anyone can tell a joke you laughed at all of them even the bad ones
And when sitting at a fine restaurant surrounded by wouldbe food critics you knew where the really good food was to be had
And finally Jim when it came to living life you lived it as Frank said it best your way and we will always love you for it
A celebration of Jims life and adventures will be held in San Francisco from 7 pm until 9 pm on April 27 2001 at 399 Webster St Casual attire
