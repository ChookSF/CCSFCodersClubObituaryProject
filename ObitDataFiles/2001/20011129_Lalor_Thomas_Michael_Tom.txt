Thomas Michael Lalor August 9 1947  October 28 2001
Tom Lalor died suddenly and unexpectedly on October 28 of a massive heart attack while on holiday in Rome the city he loved above all others He had been supremely happy that day in his beautiful pink shirt thoroughly enjoying the unseasonable sunshine and the company of Italian friends After dinner he didnt feel well and died in less than a minute to the shock and horror of all He will be buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome
Tom was born and raised in Oakland
He attended St Josephs High School and USF before taking advanced degrees in special education and audiology at USC and SFSU His specialty was teaching deaf and hardofhearing children under 5 To see him work with those kids was truly an inspiration In the late 1970s Tom traveled extensively in Asia and Australia while in recent years his travels took him mostly to Italy and Britain
In addition to his passion for travel Tom loved needlework flowers gardening puzzles of all sorts and his adored cats Ky Aja Spot and Julian He struggled until he was able to speak passable Italian Most of all he enjoyed laughter and silliness
Tom is survived by his beloved confidante and soulmate Janet Allyn and by many other friends and relatives in the Bay Area and elsewhere He lived for nearly 19 years with me Dan Morneau and I will never never forget his kindness his respect and considerateness for others and his love for me
A memorial gettogether will take place in February Call Fran or Iris at 415 2854536 for info
