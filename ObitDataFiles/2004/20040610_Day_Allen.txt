Allen Day February 28 1958  June 22 2003
Allen Day died way too soon at the tender age of 45 He was a sweet gentle man who was always trying to stay one step ahead of the many demons that chased him throughout his life Although his death was the result of a tragic accident it was wonderful to those who knew him well that he was maintaining the onestep advantage at the end As a result of the deaths of his parents and three of his siblings as well as other circumstances he died without connection to any of his family Instead Allen developed a family of care providers to whom he looked for help solace and friendship
Notwithstanding his telling one of his providers that he felt defeated most of the time he also was quite clear to all those who knew him that he would not and did not allow feelings of selfpity to diminish his search for the better life It was this indomitable spirit that en
deared him to those closest to him And when he did finally achieve stability it was a joy to see him genuinely appreciating the simple pleasures of life that we so often take for granted from anything so basic as taking a shower in his own apartmentito just lying in bed and watching a movie His joy and gratitude for these simple luxuries inspired those around him to be joyful and grateful about their own lives We sincerely hope and expect that Allen has found the peace that eluded him too often in life Gifts in his memory to the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center will be most appreciated
