My dear friend of over 38 years passed peacefully in Palm Springs after a long battle with cancer His favorite expression Who died and made me Earth Mother was
so appropriate as
he was a natural leader mover and shaker His love of interior decorating was well known and managed to turn many homes into palaces with his usual flair At an early age after seeing Cleopatra he developed aninterest in Egypt and had a vast collection of Egyptian artifacts His wit and unselfishness always putting everyone before himself will be sorely missed but never forgotten
A friend to both the Imperial and Ducal Courts he was always ready to help with anything preferring to do the jobs nobody wanted to do Its going to 7 take a lot of Earth Mothers to ever replace youf
A celebration of his life was given in Palm Springs on December 26th He is survived by his Aunt Ty sisters Bonnie Margie and Pam Thank you James and Bruce for making his last months bearable Knowing you has had such an impact on me I feel truly blessed to have had you in my life
