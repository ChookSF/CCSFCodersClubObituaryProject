Steve Stack 5/20/48  5/28/04
The w0rlds nicest guy has ended his earthly journey succumbing to multiple AIDSrelated complications Kind considerate thoughtful  Steve
was always quick
with a smile a joke a handshake or a hug In every sense of the word a blonde Sparkling blue eyes with that mischievous grin Steve was a leatherman who embraced his sexuality and sensuality He was a bodybuilder volunteer and telecommunications and human resources expert This sexy man made his way from his birthplace in Chicago to Los Angeles then San Francisco moving up and down the California coast for the next 20 years For most of the last decade Washington DC was his home but he had been planning his return to California when he left us Steve loved laughter great sex selfhelp books music from the and 70s comfort food good chocolates great coffee long nights and early mornings computers his dog Jake and his family and friends He will be dearly missed by all of those who ever had the pleasure of making his acquaintance
A memorial service on San Francisco Bay will take place on Saturday July 242004 For more information email stackmemorialaolcom
