William Scott Oliver March 4 1962 July 12 2004
My name is Tom IIogendijk On Monday Iuly 1211 Scott my partner of only eight months died from an overdose he took the Wednesday before The note said he  loved me and that I was not to be mad at him I am not mad I am and Im sure those who loved Scott are greatly saddened and relieved as he struggled long and hard with a tortuous methamphetamine addiction
Scott was/12 He was a magnificent gymnast and athlete Spoke Russian fluently and was on track to earn his Masters degree from the Monterey Institute of International Studies Of this he and I were very proud
I miss Scotts warmth kindness graciousness sweetness I miss his strength Scott was able to overcome tremendous obstacles I admire him and respect him for that And no matter how urban Scott would have liked people to believe he was to the end Scott remained to me and many he touched that wideeyed country boy from North Carolina I will always love him I will never forget him
We will be remembering Scott on Saturday Iuly 31st at 930 am at the Strybing Arboretum 8 Botanical Gar
dens in Golden Gate Park
