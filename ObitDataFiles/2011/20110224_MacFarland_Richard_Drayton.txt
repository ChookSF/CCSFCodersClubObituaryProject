Richard Drayton MacFarland February 7 1927  February 4 2011
Our beloved Richard died peacefully and quickly while waking for dinner in his chair at his long time residence in Emeryville
and sensitive man Even in declining health and sight he was always ready to face the many challenges that came his way He was preceded in death by his partner of forty years Raymond Grant who passed away in 2000
He loved his family and his friends from California to Texas from Vancouver to Toronto and beyond and his devoted caregivers Mimi was with him for six years who gave him the love and the strength to go on every day He was a proud veteran of the United States When computers were in their infancy he worked for Cal lnk  Tennesco as a Systems Analyst until his retirement Among many other things Richard enjoyed art travel conversation  into the wee hours good food and drink Richard was humorous generous appreciative caring and kind He never hesitated to offer a hand if needed He will be missed
Please make a Toast to Richard and have a Rob Roy up May he rest in peace
