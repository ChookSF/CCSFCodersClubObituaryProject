Joel E Jorgensen July 19 1946  December 31 2010
It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend Joel Jorgensen was a fixture in  The Castro district where he lived for 16 years He often referred to the Castro as his downtown where he loved visiting with shopkeepers hanging out with old friends and welcoming opportunities to make ones over a cup of Throughout his life Joel fulfilled many roles teacher caregiver counselor designer director confidante salesman and volunteer To those who knew him and even those he had often just met Joel was unabashedly irreverent delightfully depraved and generous to a fault 
A native of South Dakota Joel taught  English Speech and Theatre at Lincoln Senior High School in Sioux Falls for more than 10 years Before embarking on his teaching career Joel was an intake technician for the US Army  at what was then called the Mental Hygiene Clinic at Fort Ord California He also served honorably in Viet Nam
Like most of us life took some unexpected detours and he endured his share of disappointment but his spirit and light persevered Joel was a grateful  steward of the precious present and he eagerly shared it with everyone he met
