Ted Granger 67 died of liver cancer at approximately l l30 p m on 20 2010 died peacefully in his sleep at home in Cathedral City California To say that a hole has been left in the  hearts of Dan Livingston and Bill Brown would be a gross understatement Ted shared their lives over many years
Through the years Ted and Dan owned five successful bars located in San Francisco the Russian River and Palm Springs While Ted may be remembered by some for his gruff exterior anyone that was close to him knew his compassion for life his deep love of his family as well as Dan and Bill his fierce loyalty and his truly gentle and caring nature
You will be missed by many Ted most of all by Dan and Bill Rest in peace Our prayers are with you
