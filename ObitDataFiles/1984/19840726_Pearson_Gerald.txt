We share these words he set for the chorus to the music of Jean Sibelius The last phrase gave title to one of our first major concerts Lovers Too Have a Song to Sing
FROM THE SILENCE Surely surely from the silence Breaks the song that we never sang Come the umrds that we never spoke The IOU that weve always hidden Once all men feared so to say it
The lore that dare not speak its name A 1 last long last from the silence Lovers come bringing gifts of song Voices sing of manly love N0 more will we hush the singing more will we hide our love No more will our joy be silenced Manly love has its melody Lovers too have a song to sing
Friends may join for an informal gathering today Thursday July 26 in loving support of each other in our loss 81 The Pride Center 7 pm main auditorium upstairs I
