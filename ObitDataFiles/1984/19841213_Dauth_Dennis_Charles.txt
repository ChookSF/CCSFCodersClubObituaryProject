Dennis Charles Dauth passed away Dec 2 at the age of 3b
Dearest Love I had speculated many times in my life what would it be like to share the intimacy of a lover But never ever in my wildest dreams or imaginations could it have measured up to this reality that you and I found together
Of all l wish to remember most was your child like quality for it was your strongest characteristic that was filled with curi0sit excitement and that sense of frivolity
We once said hello and ix all began    But we shall never say goodbye for goodbyes are too final   
Thank you my friends for
you were all there when we needed you the most
Jim
