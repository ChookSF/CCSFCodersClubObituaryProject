JIM SELL
Following the party and awards affair at Chaps July 7 a small group of us were finishing off the day at Febes with a little friendly pool oompetion Ray Peterson arrived around 930 with the news  I got a phone call from Cindy Taylor Jim sell is dead
I first met Jim in 1980 It was in the playoffs and my Lubys P001 Hall team played Jims Ambush team Serious though we were it was clear to me that Jim Sell really loved to laugh
I saw him again at a league meeting during the next season and I learned that along with his ready wit he could be completely serious about communicating his thoughts In the ensuing seasons Jims many ideas had a great deal of influence on San Francisco Pool Association policy many of our present operating procedures were authored by Jim He moved from the Ambush to the Bear in 82 named his team the Bear Teddies and thats when we began seeing Mamma Bear listed in the weekly individual standings an indicator of his wit When it came to joking around you had to be pretty sharp to get one up on Jim
Jim enjoyed our league his contribution was extensive As 0111 trophy oommittee chairman he performed a more thorough job than anyone ever had Planning the awards presentations and serving as emcee he was top notch Early last year he envisioned the First National Lesbian/ Gay 3Ball Tournament and was busy laying the groundwork when he was stricken with
AIDS
In our league news of October 5 last year the first item reported J ims admittance to the hospital During one of our phone conversations he told me It sure is nice to hear from the league members  and he sounded strong and happy He spoke of taking a year off to relax after he got home
Jim was a highly organized guy who enjoyed a ehalleng1ng task Anyone who wltnessed h1s work on league projects would agree Jim liked things done with a professional touch and he truly was at all times professional
That persistent humor that sudden burst of laughter thats the Jim well all remember
