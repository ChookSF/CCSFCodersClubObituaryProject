Carlos Mauricio Menjivar
Christmas Eve at 718 pm a tear was shed as Carlos Mauricio Menjivar peacefully passed away in the comfort of his home with Edward Richard and Jerry by his side Carlos born in Puerto La Libertad El Salvador always showed a desire to travel When he arrived in San Francisco he knew from that moment forward this would always be called his home
Carlos had an unusual lust for life and an uncan
ny ability to have everyofi he met become enraptured by his personable style and cheerful approach His charming wit and happy laugh will always be remembered It was always a pleasure to be in his company
A memorial gathering planned by Jerry Garvey his lover of ten years included a mariachi band good food and good friends on Sunday Jan 17 at Chez Mallet
He will be sadly missed and happily remembered by his many many friends Q
