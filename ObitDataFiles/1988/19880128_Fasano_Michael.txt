Michael Fasano
With fond memories of our beloved Michael whose courageous strength and hope kept us on a steady path throughout his illness Michael succumbed to AIDS Jan 18
Originially  from Long Island Michael moved to San Francisco in 1976 and was an employee of US Leasing until his diagnosis two years ago
After spending
a holiday back
East Michael insisted on being in San Francisco for New Years to be with his lover and friends
Michaels kindness and sense of humor will always be yemembered Few words can express our wrenching loss Our pain is greatly eased in knowing he has ly reached his new beginning after a long valiant struggle
Our hearts go out to his loved ones who spent the past few months at his side
Contributions in Michaels memory can be made to Open Hand O
