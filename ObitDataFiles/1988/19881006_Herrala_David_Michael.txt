David Michael Herrala May ll 18 1983
David slipped out of this tightfitting shoe we call life on a warm Sunday afternoon at his home in Camp Meeker His
lover family and friends were with him David had lived in San Francisco for nine years before moving to Sonoma County one year ago He never forgot his native West Virginia and was returned there for burial
David was a longtime employee of Levi Strauss He will be remembered by many because of his involvement with the Advocate the Advocate Experience City and Community politics the Lesbian/Gay Chorus and other community efforts
Failing health did not stop David from achieving what he wanted out of life including becoming successful in real estate For the last two years he took advantage of his slowdown and traveled extensively with his lover
David well miss you
