Kenneth W Payne died peacefully in his sleep on Nov I3 one day before his 38th birthday Never sentimental rarely
pretentious Kenny waged battle on AIDS with unyielding courage and grace He undertook his campaign against the disease as he had all other endeavors in his life Through careful research and with the help of the
best consultants he could find he drew his own conclusions and developed a reasoned plan of action Always the skeptic he would bristle when he heard other PWs claim that AIDS was the best thing that ever happened to them On those rare occasions when he allowed himself to reflect on his own loss he would lament the end of his ability to engage in his greatest passion anthropology  Kenneth received his doctorate in anthropology from UCBerkeley in 1985 after conducting extensive field research in Mindanao Philippines A brilliant scholar and dedicated teacher Kenneth had served on the faculties of Washington University and State University of New York
At their annual meeting held in November in Phoenix the Society of Lesbian and Cay Anthropologists of the American Anthropological Association voted unanimously to establish an annual Kenneth W Payne Award for outstanding anthropological scholarship by a student on a gay or lesbian topic
The last years of Kennys life were spent quietly with his lover Peter Goldblum and a circle of close friends He gave us all great joy his wit his challenging mind his ability to focus totally on the task at hand His death is a loss to our community his friends and most of all to the one who loved him most May he rest in peace
