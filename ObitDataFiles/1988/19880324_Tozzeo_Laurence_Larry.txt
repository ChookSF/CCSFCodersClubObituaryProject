Larry was sent home to God last week in a splendid celebration of hundreds of his friends at Saint Paul of the Shipwreck in Hunters Point Larry died March 7 having sustained an AIDS diagnosis for 15 months
During his dozen years in the Bay Area Larry ministered to many communities and taught at a number of schools most recently at Mercy High School in San Francisco He was a Franciscan ordained in 1974 A preacher without peer his words were evocatively addressed to the recesses of the heart to those areas where we humans have lived in fear and in subjugation to the laws of a dark and sinister culture He called out of us a response to live in the light to resist cheap grace and to continue on our journeys regardless of the cost
Accompanied by gold lame fans and in later years by his starfilled wind he preached the Gospel designed to upset the satisfied in each of us He called each of us to live on the edge where he experienced most vividly the liberation the Gospel promises
Larry was taken care of by many especially in the last six months by his mother Josie and leaves behind a host of friends Tony Patty Charlie Linda Anna Judy Bill and Scott Steven and Shirley and so many others miss you and love you Larry
It was larys wish that donations be made to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation where Larry received gracious assistance from Chris Alexander when he was first diagnosed O
