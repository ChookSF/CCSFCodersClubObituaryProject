Renard Walkup Jan 31 1958June 24 1988
Renard passed on Friday night shortly after ll pm surrounded by his loved ones
Ive known Renard for the last three years of his life and I loved him dearly We met at the Castro Street Fair Sept 15 1985 We enjoyed the greatest of relation ships one that went beyond all boundries In the beginning he used to say I feel like a god because we felt so lucky to have each other Renard you will always be in my
heart and I will
have many wonderful memories to cherish You were the best thing that ever happened to me
l would like to say to anyone who has a loved one with AIDS to stick it out no matter what and to give it your all
because that is what will make the difference in their life And in the end you will have something special no one will ever take from you This is what will separate you and yours from the rest
Renard I will always love you and I know you are at peace now
Until we meet againDon
PS I sent a balloon to you from the Names Project booth at the parade I do hope youve received it by now And look for your panel in the Quilt display in Washington While writing this we felt a big tremor C
