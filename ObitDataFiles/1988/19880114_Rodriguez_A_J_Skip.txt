AJ Skip Rodriguez June 26 1947Jan 9 1983
Born in Baton Rouge LA and moved to San Francisco in 1972 Employed by Bechtel Power Corp for 14 years
Skip was preceded in death by his lover A Majewsky who succumbed to AIDS in May 1986 and fought the same battle with AIDS himself
Skip and Al were brave men who fought this disease with all of their strengths and faiths Their passing is mourned and their reunion with each other will surely be rejoiced
Skip is survived by one daughter one granddaughter three brothers and one sister
In his final days he was cared for by his loving brother Bill and his sisterinlaw Denice If there is a God then he surely smiles down on this couple They are fine examples to follow renewing lest faith in family structure love and acceptance of all lifestyles in a time when many attitudes are changing in negative ways
Hopefully Skips memory will remain with us always He was ready with a free drink a quick cash loan and a patient listening ear for many of us
Skip loved and was loved and for this I consider him a very lucky man He will remain in my heart mind and soul forever
Thank you for being part of my life and sharing your love with me Leo
