Robert S Burnham July 17 1940June ll 1938
For more than a year Bobby had not been feeling well but he never stopped or gave up and continued to work and
would not let his illness get him down Then in May he was admitted to UC Medical Center and after a threeweek stay he passed away after a courageous battle with pr1eumocys5 tis pneumonia
He was surrounded by his mother and two sisters from Tennessee and Arkansas He also leaves behind a lot of friends among them J 0An11 Joey Lydia Tom Bill and myself
Bobby was a very giving person and enjoyed life to the fullest and held no regrets He was a fountain of youth with a childhood innocence unknown to most of us His passing leaves a great void to us all and he is dearly missed
Bobby good luck in your new life and say hi to Shorty for Bob and me
