James Pike
Jim Pike passed quietly to the next plane on Thursday night Nov 17 from complications due to AIDS Jim had
struggled back from a serious bout of t0x0plasmosis in April that had threatened to take his life then He was a remarkable fighter and he had begun to live a relatively normal life again with smiles and cheers for all His biggest fear was that he would not be able to take care of himself and on the night of Nov 17 he left leaving that problem behind He was alone
We leave him this thought No one has to die your death for you and you dont have to die your death for anyone else Alone but loved by many throughout the city especially his roommates Joe and Steve He is survived by his mother father grandmother brother and two sisters in New Jersey Goodbye by dear friend Much love to you until we meet again
A memorial service will be held for J im on Tuesday Nov 29 at 4 pm in the chapel of Grace Cathedral For more information call Terry at 8630840 V
