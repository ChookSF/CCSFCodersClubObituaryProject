He was a loving son grandson brother nephew and very dearest friend to Buzz Jada Jack and Keith to name but a few
and to those of us in San Francisco who had the good fortune to share a very small but joyful and fulfilling part of his young and struggling life Dear Gary has passed to the other side to that
special Hondaparadise he so longed for after suffering a long period of painful illness at UC Long Hospital due to AIDS His dear mother Carol Jean who was also his very best friend in life held his hand in comfort at the moment of his passing to a more peaceful place
While he is survived by his loving family throughout the Valley and his many loving friends here in our city of San F raneisco there are so many more people who had the good fortune just to know Gary to share but a moment in his lifetime and we are all the more enriched While we will miss him so very much he will be with us always in our hearts and minds
Among our fondest memories of our dear Gary is how he so warmly loved animals children and the elderly and was always a helpful and caring friend and family member Although it is true that Cary was born and raised in the farm country of Stockton a refugee like so many ufus living here today he was truly a San Francisco soul And how he loved those Kent IIIs
