Lew Horowitz
Feb 2 1988 a song was sung to its last Lew Horowitz passed forever out of earshot eternally into the heart Its here that we hear him and here that we see him Lew died as he had lived with dignity without complaint with love and as always with concern for others
We who knew you Lew are grateful forever and thankful for having shared with you By just being yourself Lew we learned how to be tolerant unjudging openhearted accepting in life and perhaps as you yourself were accepting in death Thank you Lew U
