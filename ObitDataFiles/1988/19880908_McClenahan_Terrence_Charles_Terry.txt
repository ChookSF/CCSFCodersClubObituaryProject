Terrence Charles McClenahan May 2 1944Aug 20 1988
Terry died as he lived each day with quiet dignity nobility tenderness and compassion for his loved ones yet keenly anticipating his journey to a better place
We touched by his love beauty and strength will always grieve fulIy without his approval knowing that our lives are immeasurably diminished and
changed forever
To the end his keen love of travel books and music never wained Visiting Ted and Hans in Holland and the Durries home in Georgetown were integral to his carrying on
A loyal and dedicated inner circle rallied with George Pat and Terry in the final phases allowing him to remain at home His beloved friend Marty Dr Armstrong nurse Alice and aides Linda and Joy provided constant loving and devoted care up to the final morning when George took his hand and thanked him for gracing our lives
Our lives can never be the same For his mother Ella his sister Pat David and Karl brother Larry George Marty Elizabeth Nick Justin Kyle and Linda his life goes on his spirit is with us forever but a special treasure has been stolen away
So that Terry may continue to help others in need please remember the Kaiser Hospice 1425 South Main St Walnut Creek O
