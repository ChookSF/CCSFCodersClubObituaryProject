Michael Creelman
Michael died in his native New Zealand Feb 12 His parents and Bud Sue and Charles three of his AIDS volunteers who had become close and loving friends were at his bedside when he passed on Even at the last hour Michael retained a sense of humor and a smile Michael believed strongly that a person never truly dies Energy cannot be destroyed only transmuted and changed This one1ifetime of his was just one more on the path homeward Codward The soul is eternal
During Michaels four years in San Francisco he never fully lost his Kiwi charm and sense of propriety His friends will remember his trademark expression Yeth thar and penchant for garlic concoctions Michael was a triple Sagittarius through and through he liked fast motorCycles meeting people and parties could talk up a storm and could never get around to buying new shoelaces unless someone got them for him
His work as a friendly and demanding gym instructpr at the Body Center gained him the respect and friendship of many of his clients as well as the results his methods produced on his own terrifioally handsome body He loved San Francisco and one of his hopes and wishes had been to somehow return and see his friends before he died
Michael I love you and will miss you Youre in my heart O
