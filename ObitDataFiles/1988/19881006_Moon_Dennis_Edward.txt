Dennis Edward Moon June 12 1955Sept 27 1936
Dennis Moon was born in Erie Pennsylvania the son of Glen and Pauline Moon He arrived in San Francisco sometime during the spring of 1978 determined to enroll in a modeling school and begin his life anew
He was promptly taken by the modeling agency which absconded with his money only to inform him he had no future in modeling
Having reached the end of hisfur1ds Dennis began working thestreete prostitute He did this not with the attitude of the typical street hustler who seeks only to take advantage but approached all of his clients with compassion and a desire to fill their emotional needs which far superseded the ordinary requirement of physical satisfactionwhich he was more than capable of ing
Since Dennis did not wish to continue the lifestyle of the street scene he decided to investigate the avenue of receiving professional help to ingettin g this life back on a constructive course
He will be remembered by many he helped at the Recreation Center for the Handicapped the California League for the Handicapped and Creativity Explored where he did his most profound work in art therapy and was greatly valued for his sensitivity
At the same time Dennis volunteer activities ensued he also created many provocative works of his own art that were enjoyed by many expressing the childlike quality that many artists strive a lifetime to achieve
On March 24 1984 Dennis was diag nosed with AIDS His approach in dealing with this condition was to live life to the fullest in a time where living with AIDS was barely considered by most as an alternative to dying with AIDS Except for certain debilitating times that his condition would not allow it he was constantly enjoying life seeking alternative therapies sharing his love with others never losing sight ofhis love for Cod and the ultimate good in humanity During this time he learned much from the teachings of The Prosperos and Louise Hay which together with his own form of loving Christianity became a cornerstone of his own personal philosophy
Dennis parents visited him in the final days of his life at the insistence of his father who I believe knew he would have one final opportunity for resolve
He is missed by many including Katherine Burt Jenny Liz Bill Jackie Michael Jeff Alan David K David W David F Paul Phillip Ilene Randi Gene and of course myself Stephen his devoted lover of six years
