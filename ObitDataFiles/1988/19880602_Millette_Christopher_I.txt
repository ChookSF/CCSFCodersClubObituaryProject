Christopher I Millette
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life  
Chris shared his goodness and mercy with each individual he knew He gave the homeless a place
to sleep he was supportive of people who were just diagnosed with AIDS and didnt quite know what to do next he fed the hungry and he listened
Chris was further inspired however after his own diagnosis in July 1987 with the truth and reality of how such a terrible disease could bring out the love warmth and support of so many friends and family This was a new and beautiful beginning for Chris even though he was a person with AIDS himself 
His greatest love and concerns were for the children so much so that he worked with others to establish a support and information center Children With AIDS
Chris touched us all with his goodness and mercy in the hope that continuous suppbrt and love would be shared with each other before the illnesses before the loneliness before the despair and most of all 10 remember the children I
