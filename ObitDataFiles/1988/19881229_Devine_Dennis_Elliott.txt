Dennis Elliott Devine May 23 1946NOV 22 1988 Elliott gave up his AIDSravaged body
at the end of a healing session held by some of his good friends The energy was palpable as Elliott left his body We took Elliotts ashes to Jenner where we wrote his name in the sand and filled in the impression with his ashes We then read from ourjournals read a poem and said goodbye We gave ourselves a group hug and just as we turned to walk away a wave came up and ocmpletely washed away all
of the ashes Perhaps it was coincidence
Elliott was an unusual person who came from the heart more often than not and he always tried to be real to himself I believe the special teacher that was in Elliott is within all ofus but 0 Elliott had such a flair for the dramatic When Elliott was interviewed for part of an AIDS special on Channel 3 he looked at the camera directly and said Im ready to go When Elliott left his body I felt a distinct rebirth experience not1 classically defined death drama Thank you universe for the gift of my friend Elliott
