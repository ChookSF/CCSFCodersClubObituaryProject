My dear friend Bill 33 left this life
peacefully April 22 His struggle is over
and his spirit free
Born in St Louis he graduated from the University of Missouri and in 1977 made SF his home Hell be most remember
ed for his warm
giving nature and wild sense of humor Just being around him made you feel good
Diagnosed with AIDS in February 1986 Bill left his job at Walter Thompson to enjoy life and gradually dissolved ties with his friends determined not to burden them with his illness Always believing in tomorrow he fought many illnesses until dementia his most frustrating fight of all Yet he never lost his gentle sweet nature Im grateful he trusted and allowed me to be there for him
My heartfelt thanks to everyone at Garden Sullivan Coming Home Hospice and Shanti for your tender care and for all the support you gave to me these last four months Youre very special people
Ill always miss him He was my best buddy and all Id ever wish for in a brother
With love Anita I
