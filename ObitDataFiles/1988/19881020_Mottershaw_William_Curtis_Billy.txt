In the early morning hours of Sept 30 our beloved friend Billy passed away in his sleep after a fivemonth battle

Billy a longtime resident of Niles CA loved the outdoors and all of the beauty that the canyon had He loved to hike and collect small pieces of
nature such as oddshaped rocks colorful feathers and small pieces of wood floating down the creek to make mobiles
My sincerest thanks to the staff of Ward B3 at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro for the utmost care and attention they gave to Billy during his illness especially Marcie Sue Dave Rosemary and Walter
Rest in peace my love Your lover Terry will never let your memory fade and you will always remain in my heart Until we meet in that great patch in the sky    C  Ya Y
