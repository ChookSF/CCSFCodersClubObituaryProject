In the early morning hours of Dec 4 our friend Rey passed beyond our presence peacefully while asleep in his home on the Russian River with close friends and pets nearby
Throughout his painful five year struggle with AIDS he lived each day with ined strength and courage help
ing and caring for many afflicted friends During his last few months he helped us to put aside our concept of reality and be willing to accept that which seemed beyond our Love which would carry our beloved Rey to his Perfect Place
His many friends will always remember his glorious smile and beaming personality His deep love for nature animals people and his everexpanding mind gave Rey a spiritual presence which touched many lives in very positive ways He will be deeply missed but his love will live on in our hearts forever
Friends are invited to celebrate Reys life and 50th birthday Jan 29 1938 on Saturday Jan 30 4 pm at the Rusty Nail Bar 9117 River Road near Forestville O
