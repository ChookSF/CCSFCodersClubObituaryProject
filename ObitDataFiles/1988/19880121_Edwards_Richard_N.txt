Richard N Edwards
Richard N Edwards 45 journeyed forth peacefully on the last day of 1987 after a fourmonth battle with cancer Now free to travel unrestrained Richard is surely in his glory exploring the globe and making new friends was the true love of his life
Wherever he went from his childhood home area of Metropolitan Washington and Virginia to Vietnam where he served with the Navy Richard made lasting friendships for he was truly a caring man
After working for the Associated Press on the East Coast he moved to the Bay Area in 1969 and worked for the Kaiser Health Plan for more than 10 years Nearly every weekend was happily spent on his sailboat with friends His lifelong love of the water never diminished
His planned twomonth trip to Europe in I982 stretched to a love affair especially with Italy where he found a new extended family in Florence He returned to the US in 1984 but left a great part of himself with his beloved Florentines
His loved ones here and elsewhere will
miss his loving friendship Bon Voyage Richard
