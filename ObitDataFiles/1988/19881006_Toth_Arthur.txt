Art is gone now but he left us a world of kind and good thoughts positive values warmth and a lot of love His family and many friends may now feel the void but he will never be gone to many of us who experienced his kindness and his love As a friend to many he will be missed but as a special human being he will always be with us
Thanks Art for the experience and for
the love from all those people whose lives you touched 0
