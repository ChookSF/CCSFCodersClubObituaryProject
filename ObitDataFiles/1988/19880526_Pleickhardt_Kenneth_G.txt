Kenneth G Pleickhardt Feb 8 1958May 18 1988
We lost our beloved Kenneth early Wednesday morning May 18
Everyone who talks about Ken always uses the words gentle kind and courageaus His determination was so strong he convinced us all that he would beat AIDS Ken led a very joyful life and never let his illness intrude upon that joy Ken enjoyed working at PGE for over seven years making many friends in computer operations and gas supply management
Kenneth will be greatly missed by Jim his lover of seven years his many dear friends and his family Even when he was very sick Ken would focus on the feelings and needs of others naturally and trusively We all feel so fortunate that we shared his selfless and unconditional love
