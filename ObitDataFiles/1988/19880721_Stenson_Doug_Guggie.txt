With Dougs typical style of total involvement in his pursuits he thoroughly immersed himself in photography and distance running especially during his several years in Boston His diverse interests included support of Save the Tule Elk to his leadership in bringing Bos tons Gay Games I athletes to San Francisco in 1982
From the time you first heard Dougs cheerful howdy you could tell his intelligent wit and individuality were unmistakable

A fond farewell for now Doug We love you U
