O Gavin White Nov 23 1940Oct 7 1983
Gavin White died suddenly on Oct 7 from what was later diagnosed as pneumocystis pneumonia
Gavin was a man who enriched our lives with genuine love and caring He was always concerned about his friends and encouraged them to be better people
He will be remembered for his free spirit his wit his disgustingly wonderful charm his ereativity and talent his knack for running late and outofgas his love for the spontaneous a propensity for good food and wine his sometimes endless laughs and his incredibly strong and caring hugs A toast to Gavins new life and a hope that he has found what this life could not offer him that mantodiefor an endless bank account and a flying carpet with a full tank of gas
We love you Gavin and will always remember you Patrick Y
