Starr Deutsch 1957 1938
On the 16th of January our beloved friend Starr passed away and though his life has closed so early in its course his love will live with us we pray for the repose of such a caring soul Through all his pain and suffering he remained a shining light whose strength comforted him to the last His clear eye has led us to see what we thought would not A pass he helped us through his passing he brought
us through our fear of passing we saw the clear light if only for a moment
Let us remember Starr who fashioned stained glass and worked at finish carpentry as one who gave us strength through his own example Though this loss is deeply felt by his family and friends his love will live on in our hearts
A memorial service was held on Tuesday Jan 19 at California Funeral Services
