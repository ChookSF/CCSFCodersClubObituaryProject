Donald Allen Baldwin March 1 1944Aug 9 1988
Donald passed quietly away on the afternoon of Aug 9 1988 after more than a years struggle with AIDS His favorite
Barbra Streisand songs have already been played and his ashes scattered according to his wishes He was an extremely handsome man tall strapping and blond with the sort of suntanned casualness often associated with fashion magazines Yet he was a very real vulnerable person His physical attributes were abundantly matched by a sweet disposition and a ready sense of humor Dons special gift was to make everything light and to bring lasting joy to his friends He was a sensitive generous and loving person who cared deeply about those close to himtruly a gentleman and an enduring friend Practicality was outside of his experience and he was dearly loved in spite of and perhaps because of it
He was born on March 1 1944 in Southern California and remained enamoured of sunshine and warm climates Professionally Don was a talented interior designer once associated with Michael Taylor ln the last two years of his life he endured great pain following the abrupt and bitterly unhappy end ing of a seemingly stable 20year relationship His grief was profound but he summoned suffioient strength to grow beyond it Illprepared for independence he nevertheless bravely dealt with maintaining a single life and establishing his own identity in midlife
Don made tremendous strides toward building a new life of his own Close friends and family remained loyally by him while he pursued making new friends and seeking love He found solace in the Metropolitan Community Church and the good people there offered him added meaning and contributed meaningfully toward a new sense of fulfillment His last eight months in this life were finally unclouded by mourning Although he knew that he would imminently die he was happy and enjoying himself at long last
We his friends will miss seeing him joking and talking with him sharing confidencesoving him Although we won have him across the table to share cocktails or dinners our dear Donald will live as long as we have minds and hearts to remember and care U
