On a Sunday morning you shifted and with a bare glance back at the body you had walked in these 37 years you rejoined the Source and the Light
How you must smile with relief and amusement All that time youd identified so closely with the big sunradiant boysterous beefystrong but vulnerable and finally discarded vehicle with all its angles and thrashings its gristle and spice How do you feel having taken that clump You ornamented a room with your presence alone Buz but you werent satisfied until youd succeeded in leaving behind your artful surfaces to arrest the eye and intrigue the mind An inspired trailblazer you achieved recognition at last in partnership with David who shared your life Together you threw yourselves devotedly into bringing your vision to the public eye
Thanks to you we are richer We recall with gratitude how many ways you showed us how to live with passion verve and mad sanity We havent lost you y0ure in us ally0ur loving David Florence Nancy Thomas Ricki Tommy 0 Cash and all of us who known0 no we can never lose you at all Please contact David Weyrauch for details concerning a memorial service in the near future 213 2994252 Leave message O
