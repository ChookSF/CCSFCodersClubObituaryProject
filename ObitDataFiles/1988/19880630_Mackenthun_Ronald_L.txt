Surrounded by his mother and family members Ron passed away after a lengthy battle with AIDS He was a patien in a Minneapolis convalescent home since last November leaving the Bay Area in the summer months when he knew his ihness had progressed
Together with his partner the late Paul Battaglia he formed Creeksifle Farms in Petaluma They were flower growers who supplied garden roses and other special flowers to their wholesale customers at the San Francisco Flower Market They provided the more unusual materials that floral designers were asking for and set the precedent for field grasses and holiday wreaths created of rosehip vines
Ron is survived by his mother Martha a brother Steve sisters Mary Colleen and Cathy and their families all of the Minneapolis area He will be remembered by the many people he had made friends with over the years as a Pan Am flight attendant and with his flower family as well as those in the city at the River and in Petaluma
Memorials may be directed in Rons name to Minneapolis AIDS Project 2025 Nicollet Ave Minneapolis MN 55404 The care and friendship from these volunteers was especially important to Ron and his family
While there is relief that his pain is over there will always be sorrow that we can no longer enjoy his smile and his company I
