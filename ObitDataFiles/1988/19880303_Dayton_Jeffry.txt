Jeffry Dayton
In a tea room unexpectedly we met the evening of January 7 1968 when you cruised me not especially eager I invited you h0meyet we made love all night long At dawn you looked and said I love you I said What did you say and you You heard me
The last time we were alone together you 95 years old an inmate at Dachau knowing your time was near barely able to lift your still beautiful artistmusicians handstoo heavy with AIDS I leaned over your bed and said what I hadnt in 18 years I love you very much Jeff Very slowly you answered I love you too i
Once you said We d0nt need wet pencils on the back ofthe tdilet And you put up with my winedrunk insanity and tears when Bobby Kennedy was killed and from our porch I screamed at the Universe N0 No N0 And we marched with flowers for Pe0ples Park You took care of me for richer or poorer in sickness and in health And for a heaven while we were one flesh Now you are released
Survived by your deeply caring parents Wally and Marea exwife Linda boy Christopher 16 by your last special friend Paul by Max Bill David Joanna Rudy me Holman Monell and many Let us move from mourning into morning Your Cod was merciful your suffering was brief The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord
We had our time it had an end and so I say S0 long beloved friend Q
