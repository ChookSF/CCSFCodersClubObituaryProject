Anthony Tony Leonardo Warf Feb 25 l952March 10 1938
Theres another empty corner on Castro Street For years Tony practiced his art through hairdressing in the back booth of Louies Barber Shop on Castro near Market He was as much a hallmark of the ateas color and vitality as the neon sign which lights the Castro Theater
Tony loved his work and gave much of himself to others making countless hairdresser homevisits to clients who were too ill to come to his shop most often he did this without charge Tony was a sweet and gentle man who could spot phoniness in others and never hesitated to make it known there was a certain charm in this The vacant spot left at his passing can never quite be filled
Because of the support provided by the AIDS Foundation Tony was well taken care of in his last days A deep and heartfelt thanks to Michael Lynch Michael Lee and all the fellas at the house who made such a difference Coming Home Hospice provided a gentle atmosphere and loving attention which enabled Tony to let go with ease and grace so that he died very peacefully
Love and thanks to Joe Doyle Jerry Crieffner Larry Laterza and many others of the staff there Thank you Barry Day Thank you Stan Watson Anyone wishing to acknowledge their affection and respect to Tonys memory could do so through a small donation to the AIDS Foundation AIDS Emergency Fund or Coming Home Hospice
We love you Tony O
