He loved and spoke fluent French having worked for many months at a hospital in Surennes which is on the outskirts of Paris He also had tremendous energy as shown by his more recent and intense interest in studying and learning how to read and speak Russian and Greek He often practiced playing on his mandolin and he was recently starting to learn Braille
The table setup at Shanti with the candle and beautiful fresh flowers by other Shanti volunteers and friends was a most touching memorial He would have wished a huge thank you to everyone for everything done to help him especially during the last three months He dearly loved life and will be sorely missed His goal in life was to be the universal man
