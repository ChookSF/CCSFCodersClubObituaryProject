Christopher is at peace having departed this world May 22 1988 He will be sadly missed by his family and by his many friends and acquaintances
Christopher struggled courageously for three long years determined to heal himself of the cancer which slowly consumed his rugged physical frame and handsome face btit never broke his generous spirit The public may remember reading about Christopher in a featured article Christophers Courage in the Sunday July 12 1987 San Francisco Chronicle or remember him as the person with AIDS selling his original greeting cards and posters in the city streets Others yet may remember him for being the evertenacious and resourceful photographer
He was more than that a rare and wonderful friend adventurous creative studious loyal loving and frenzied who taught us more than we could have ever envisioned about lessons in life love and death We love you Christopher Someday we shall all he together
