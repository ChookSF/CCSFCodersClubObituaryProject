Before and during his illness Patrick was active in the MCC He worked in and spoke to various groups never failing to be a help to others He was richly rewarded with an unending stream of love and help from everyone during his time of need
Patrick is survived by his mother Dorothy and sisters Geri and Linda He is further survived by his loyal companion and lover Michael Hawkins and all of us in his California family who loved him so much
Peace be with you our friend
